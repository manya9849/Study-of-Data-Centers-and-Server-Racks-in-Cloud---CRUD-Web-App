## ☁ Study of Data Centers and Server Racks in Cloud – Mini Project




## 1. Introduction


Cloud computing runs on massive data centers packed with servers, racks, and networking systems. This project focuses on understanding how these facilities operate while building a simple web app that manages data-center data using Firebase.




## 2. Objectives

Understand architecture & components of cloud data centers

Study server racks and their role in cloud infrastructure

Build a functional webpage for managing data-center records

Implement CRUD operations using Firebase Cloud Firestore

Use Git/GitHub for version control

Test the system and document challenges






## 3. Firebase Cloud Firestore

Google’s NoSQL database with real-time sync, secure storage, and simple CRUD integration.


Why Firebase?

Easy setup

Real-time updates

Secure cloud database

Smooth CRUD functionality




## 4. Implementation

4.1 Tools and Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for webpage UI and logic
Firebase Firestore – for storing data center details
Firebase Web SDK – to connect the webpage to the cloud database
Git & GitHub – for version control and repository hosting
VS Code – development environment


4.2 System Workflow
1. User opens the webpage.
2. Enters data center details such as name, location, capacity, and status.
3. Data is stored in Firebase.
4. Users can update or delete entries.
5. Real-time reflection of changes on the screen.



4.3 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

2. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the app

python app.py

4. Open in browser

http://localhost:5000/

## 6. Results


Functional webpage for storing & displaying data-center info

Fully working Add, Read, Update, Delete operations

Real-time syncing with Firestore

Input validation + error handling implemented

Tested across multiple cases with consistent results



## 7. Testing & Evaluation

Test Cases Performed:

Add Data Inserted new data center entry	-Passed

Read Data	Displayed entries from Firestore-	Passed

Update Data	Modified existing entry-Passed

Delete Data	Removed entry successfully-	Passed

Invalid Input	Ensured validation messages-Passed
