Study of Data Centers and Server Racks in Cloud – Mini Project


📌 Project Overview:

This project is a web-based application developed as part of a Cloud Computing mini project.
It allows users to store, manage, and manipulate information about various data centers, including server rack details. The system performs full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and uses Firebase as the backend cloud storage solution.


🚀 Features:

Add New Data Center — store essential details.
View All Data Centers — real-time data retrieval from Firebase.
Update Existing Records — edit stored entries.
Delete Records — remove data center details as needed.
Cloud Database Integration — powered by Firebase Realtime Database / Firestore.
Clean UI for Easy Interaction.


🛠 Tech Stack:

Frontend

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Backend / Cloud

Firebase (Firestore/Realtime Database)
Firebase SDK for client-side operations

Tools

Git & GitHub
VS Code
Windows PowerShell


🧩 How It Works

1. User fills in data center details via the web interface.
2. Data is sent to Firebase using API calls.
3. Firebase stores the data securely in the cloud.
4. Webpage fetches and displays updated records instantly.
5. Users can edit or delete entries — updates reflect in real time.


📝 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
2. Install dependencies
